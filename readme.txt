To host large files for click to chat pro plugin.

== Description ==

To host large files. 

Some plugin features required to add large files. (but that feature may uses by a very few users)
Instead of adding all the files in the pro plugin. We created a plugin to host large files.

Two ways pro plugin can call this files.

1. [Click to Chat Files](https://holithemes.com/shop/downloads/click-to-chat-files/) plugin (or)
2. public repository at [github](https://github.com/holithemes/click-to-chat-files). 

If Click to Chat Files plugin is installed on same site, click to chat pro plugin call files from same site. i.e form this plugin. Else it calls from public repository hosted at github using jsdelivr CDN.


== Number (Intltel input) field ==

Number field with country code with flag.
Number placeholder as per country code.
localization.

This all required a lot of files to be hosted. instead of adding all this files directly to the pro plugin. we added a separate plugin to host all this files.
