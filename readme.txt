To host large files for the click-to-chat-pro plugin.

== Description ==

To host large files. 

Some plugin features are required to add large files. (but that feature may used by a very few users)
Instead of adding all the files to the pro plugin, we created a plugin to host large files.

There are two ways the pro plugin can call these files

1. [Click to Chat Files](https://holithemes.com/shop/downloads/click-to-chat-files/) plugin (or)
2. public repository at [github](https://github.com/holithemes/click-to-chat-files). 

If Click to Chat Files plugin is installed on the same site, click to chat pro plugin calls files from same site. i.e. form this plugin. Otherwise, it calls from a public repository hosted at github using jsdelivr CDN.


== Number (Intltel input) field ==

Number field with country code with flag.
Number placeholder as per country code.
localization.

This all required a lot of files to be hosted. instead of adding all these files directly to the pro plugin. we added a separate plugin to host all these files.
