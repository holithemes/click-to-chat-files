== Description ==

To host large files. 

Some plugin features required to add large files. so we added a plugin to host large files.
public repository at github. 
useful to call directory. using jsdelivr for cdn or directly from github.

== Number (Intltel input) field ==

Number field with country code with flag.
Number placeholder as per country code.
localization.
